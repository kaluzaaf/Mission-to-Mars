# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
The ultimate purpose of the project is to help a friend who is building a website that will pull information from around the web about Mars. The main objective for our friend is to get the attention of NASA so she will ultimately be hired by them.

## Approach
We used our skills to build a website that reaches into several websites and obtains news and picutres of Mars. 

## Outcome
The end result is a one stop shop where people can go and find out the latest and greatest about Mars. It will also help our friend get noticed by NASA.
